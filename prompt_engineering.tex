\section{Prompting techniques}

Prompting techniques encode human priors, making it difficult to assess a language model's intrinsic reasoning abilities \cite{wang2024chainofthoughtreasoningprompting}

\subsection{Prompt engineering}
In many modern LLM applications, prompts have become programs themselves. \cite{schnabel2024symbolicpromptprogramsearch}
Motivation for prompt engineering is to improve the model's capabilities not by changing the underlying weights with training on data but by crafting an optimal instruction string, or a prompt.
This can be done by providing examples of the task as a part of the prompt or by instructing the model how to solve the task.

\subsubsection{In-context learning}
Prompts are distinguished based on the number of included examples.
\begin{table}[h!]

    \begin{tabular}{|c|p{8cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Prompting Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Zero-shot Prompting & Prompt has no examples. Model relies on its pre-trained knowledge. \\
    \hline
    One-shot Prompting & Prompt has one example to guide the model. \\
    \hline
    Few-shot Prompting & Prompt includes a few examples (typically 2 to 5). \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparison of Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot Prompting}
\end{table}        
Research\cite{brown2020languagemodelsfewshotlearners} has shown that with growing model size the knowledge-generalizing ability of the model increases. Instead of expensive fine-tuning
models can reuse knowledge from pre-training and solve many tasks when provided just by a few examples.

Few-shot prompting highlights that LLMs can be seen as powerful pattern-completion engines. \cite{meyerson2024languagemodelcrossovervariation}

Providing a prompt of examples from a distribution can condition the LLM to generate further high-probability examples from that distribution \cite{meyerson2024languagemodelcrossovervariation}
